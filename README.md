# Solution

*  Analyzing 2014-2015 dataset with past sales
*  Identifying individual and joined factors.
*  Prepairing features for the model
*  Calculate all the features coefficients 
*  Testing the results

# Objectives

*  How multiple features work together?
*  Quantifying joined features effect
*  Building a predictive model
* Building a front end for a customer




# Data
***
#### King County house sales dataset contains:
*  details for 22,000 sold houses
*  final sales prices 

All the data is from 2014-2015 




# Features Identified
#### Main Features: 
* House Sq footage 
* Grade of design and materials quality
* Zipcode
* Waterfront
* View



## Additional Features: 
* Lot size
* Basement
* House Age

#### Only marginal effect from:
* Number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and floors

# Data Modeling
#### An iterative approach to data modeling 
-  Calculating Efficiency for basic features  
-  Prepairing model features
-  Training multiple models
-  Chosing the most efficient model 
-  Testing against different subset of data


* ## Prepared Data for Modeling using custom "transform_data" function (see functions_v1.4.py)  


* ## Created/trained model using statsmodels.OLS  


* ## Made sure r-square is good  



```python
# Create OLS linear model
pred_fin, price_fin = transform_data(initial_pred, initial_price)

pred_int = sm.add_constant(pred_fin)
model = sm.OLS(price_fin,pred_int).fit()

coef_df=model.params.reset_index()
coef_df.columns=["Column","Value"]
```

# custom functions to get coefficients from <br>OLS and calculate the formula of the slopes

* used custom function "calcuate_price" and "get_coeff" to get coefficients from ols model (see functions_v1.4.py

# Creating UI forms


```python
## Importing Widgets Forms
%run code/Build_Forms_v1.4.py


inp={ 'view':viewW,'waterfront':waterW,
    'zipcode': zipW, 'decade':decadeW, 'grade':gradeW, 'basement':basementW, "mean_price":meanW,
    'sqft_living':livingW,'sqft_lot':lotW }

output = widgets.interactive_output(calculate_price, inp )



ui = widgets.VBox([form, output])

output.layout={'border': '3px solid green', 'width':'150px'}

```

# Building a Front End Tool:


```python
display(ui)
```


    VBox(children=(Box(box_style='success', children=(Box(children=(Text(value='Predicting House Sale Prices for Kâ€¦


# Testing
***

We made sure the tool works as expected:
* Multiple comparissons of predicted data against the actual data
* Predicted price is within 90-110% of actual price (houses newer than 1980)
* Predicted price is within 87-113% of actual price (houses older than 1980)
***

# Conclusions
***

#### Considerations and Limitations:


* The tool can be effective to estimate base price for known features
* In the future a model should be re-trained with more up-to-date data
* The presented prototype will be greatly improved by more advanced modeling
